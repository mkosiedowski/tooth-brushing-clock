# tooth-brushing-clock
Code for Arduino Tooth Brushing clock with SSD1306 0,96'' OLED display

This project runs on ATmega 168 controller, so can be run with cheap Aruino Nano boards

With ATmega 168 based Arduino Nano you will most probably need a pull-up resistor on SCL & SDA inputs of your OLED screen. Just connect them to proper A4/A5 output ports of your Arduino board and also connect them through 10kÎ© resistor to 5V output of your board
